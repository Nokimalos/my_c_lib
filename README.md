# my_lib

Hi ! It's Noki and this repo is for all the functions of the LIB C that I code.

There are some Unit Tests made with Criterion for some functions.

## Unit Test with Criterion

Coverage :

         - Lines : 100%
         - Branches : 93.3%

How to test to compile the Lib and see the tests :
         
         - 1. make re (If you don't have make : sudo dnf install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel)

         - 2. firefox covr.html

Enjoy :)
